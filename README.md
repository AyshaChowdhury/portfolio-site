## 🎨 Design Choices
- **Color Scheme:** [Adobe Color Scheme](https://color.adobe.com/mythemes)
- **Gradient Used:** Linear gradient background applied to left and right column on Home Page."
- **Fonts and Theme:** 

For my Home Page, I decided to use a **linear gradient background** because it blends nicely with the main image and adds a modern touch. The gradient also helps tie the whole page together visually without making it look too flat or plain.

The **image** I chose gives off a **playful and futuristic vibe**, which really connects with my personality. I liked how it shows someone brainstorming with colorful ideas all around. It represents how I enjoy thinking creatively and finding new ways to solve problems.

I picked a **font** that matches this fun, imaginative tone. It feels approachable and friendly, which is the kind of energy I want my portfolio to have.

For the **font color**, I went with a shade that really pops against the purple background. I wanted something bold and easy to read, while also standing out enough to grab attention.

When choosing my **color palette**, I pulled inspiration from the image itself — mainly purples, oranges, and yellows. I liked how these colors work together to give a bright yet balanced look, keeping the page both engaging and easy on the eyes.
