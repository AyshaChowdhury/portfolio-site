## Design Choices
- **Color Scheme:** [Adobe Color Scheme](https://color.adobe.com/mythemes)
- **Gradient Used:** Linear gradient background applied to left and right column on Home Page."
- **Fonts and Theme:** 

## Home Page
For my Home Page, I decided to use a **linear gradient background** because it blends nicely with the main image and adds a modern touch. The gradient also helps tie the whole page together visually without making it look too flat or plain.

The **image** I chose gives off a **playful and futuristic vibe**, which really connects with my personality. I liked how it shows someone brainstorming with colorful ideas all around. It represents how I enjoy thinking creatively and finding new ways to solve problems.

I picked a **font** that matches this fun, imaginative tone. It feels approachable and friendly, which is the kind of energy I want my portfolio to have.

For the **font color**, I went with a shade that really pops against the purple background. I wanted something bold and easy to read, while also standing out enough to grab attention.

When choosing my **color palette**, I pulled inspiration from the image itself ‚Äî mainly purples, oranges, and yellows. I liked how these colors work together to give a bright yet balanced look, keeping the page both engaging and easy on the eyes.

## Contact Page

For my Contact page, I wanted to make it simple, clear, and easy to use while keeping the same color theme as the rest of the website. I divided the layout into two columns - one for the image and one for the form.

The **image** on the right side represents communication and connection. It fits the overall aesthetic of my site and helps the page feel more lively and engaging.

On the **left side**, I added a ‚ÄúGet in Touch‚Äù heading followed by a form that allows users to contact me directly. I included input fields for name, email, phone number, and a message box, as well as an optional checkbox for joining my mailing list. I used the `mailto:` action so that the form opens the user‚Äôs email client when they click submit.

I made sure that all fields are **required** so users can‚Äôt submit an incomplete form.

The **Submit button** uses a gradient that blends orange and peach tones, similar to the colors used in my navigation hover effects. This helps maintain consistency..

Overall, I designed this page to feel warm, welcoming, and user-friendly.
